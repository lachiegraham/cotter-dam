# You'll need to decide what other functions you want for Question 6
# It should be clear from your code, what we need to do in order to produce the plot(s).


# Code in the following if statement will only be executed when this file is run - not when it is imported.
# If you want to use any of your functions (such as to answer questions) please write the code to
# do so inside this if statement. We'll cover it in more detail in an upcoming lecture.
